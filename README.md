# etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project.

Start date: June 19, 2017

End date: June 21, 2017

Notes: 
- I originally put all the divs for each square within a table, but was having some spacing issues.  Specifically, I could not get the heights to adjust the way I wanted them to and they would spill out of the bottom of the main container.  I decided to remove the table and just put the divs within row divs. This proved to be more effective.

- Overall, I felt like the project went well.  I had fun making it and adding options to it.  I will probably come back to it once I know more and tweak some more things.


- Spectrum Colorpicker came from Brian Grinstead.  I did not make it and do not take credit for it.
